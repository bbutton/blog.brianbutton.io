Sorry for the crass commercialism, but I thought I&rsquo;d post this to my blog to see if anyone was interested.

Agile Solutions Group will be offering another in its series of public Test Driven Development classes, July 13&ndash;15 in St. Louis, MO. The class covers both refactoring and test first programming, which together make up TDD. The session is about 20% lecture, 30% example, and 50% lab, so you&rsquo;ll get a chance to really get your hands dirty with this stuff. I promise close, personal attention for each student and lots of coaching, both during class and afterwards, once you return to work.

Please contact me at <bbutton@agilestl.com> if you are interested or have further questions.

I return you to your regularly scheduled rants ðŸ™‚
