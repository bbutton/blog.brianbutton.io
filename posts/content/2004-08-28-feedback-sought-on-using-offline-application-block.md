Has anyone out there written any code using the [Offline Application Block][1]? If so, Microsoft would love to talk with you. patterns&practices is actively looking at what changes should be made to the OAB for version 2, so any feedback would be great.

In particular, we are looking for information on how easy the API was to use and understand, if there were any things that you were trying to do with the block that were impossible or needlessly difficult, and any new features or tooling that you&#8217;d like to see. The best avenue for giving this feedback is to join the Offline Application Block [GotDotNet workspace][2].
