One of the best parts about working with Ward Cunningham when he and I were at patterns & practices is that I&rsquo;d get to listen to him, and hear these gems of wisdom fairly often. Now that we&rsquo;re both gone from p&p, I&rsquo;m reduced to finding these quotes as they are relayed by others. Here is a quote from Ward that really captures the essence of what it means to write great Agile code:

_Take all the time&nbsp;you need to make the code as high quality as it can be, but don&#8217;t take any time to add functionality that you don&#8217;t need at the moment._
