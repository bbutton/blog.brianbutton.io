One of the best gigs I&rsquo;ve had in my whole life has been working with the great people at Microsoft&rsquo;s patterns & practices group. These people are responsible for solving interesting problems in interesting new ways, and sharing their code and learnings with you, fellow Microsoft developers.

At this point, they&rsquo;re looking to hire another developer to join their team. I warn you &mdash; the bar is high. They interview many and accept only the best. I&rsquo;m not sure how they let me in &mdash; probably because I&rsquo;m only a consultant, not an employee!

So, go ahead and swallow the blue pill. Check out [Darrell Snow&rsquo;s][1] blog for details.
