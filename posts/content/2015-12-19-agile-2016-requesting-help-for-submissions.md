# Agile2016 Submissions : Asking for Help

Submitting a session proposal for a major conference can be a daunting task, especially if it is your first time. You&#8217;re putting your thoughts and ideas out there, knowing that a team of experts will read your words and eventually come to a decision about whether your submission is selected for the final program.

Everyone on each track team knows exactly how you feel, because we&#8217;ve all done it, too. Fortunately for us, we were able to ask for feedback from experts and peers while we crafted our sessions. In many cases, that feedback was instrumental in creating a successful submission.

In keeping with the Agile principle of rapid feedback, we&#8217;d like you to know that you can get that very same kind of feedback on your submissions, too. All you have to do is ask!

### Asking for Help

On the form where you create your proposal, you&#8217;ll find three large, colorful buttons used to submit your changes. These buttons represent the stages through which your submission can pass. These stages are important, because they define how the track team will treat your proposal.

In the **Draft** stage, you can incrementally create and improve their submission for as long as they want. You&#8217;re basically alone during this time, although you can still receive public comments on your content.

The **Ask For Help** stage is where you can ask members of your track team to review and give feedback on your content. The track team members are experts in the subject matter of their tracks and in knowing what it takes to create a great submission. They will answer questions, offer advice, and do anything you need to help make your submission as perfect as possible. One note &#8211; **no feedback is offered until you Ask for Help!!!**

Please use this help early and often in creating your submission. You have an entire team of people per track who are ready and willing to help you create a great session. All you have to do is ask them!

The final stage, **Ready for Evaluation**, is for sessions the author views as complete, well structured, and ready to be evaluated for inclusion in the final program. **No help will be offered in this stage.** Track team members may ask clarifying questions as they evaluate all submissions, but the assumption is that you&#8217;re ready for that evaluation.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks for reading this far. Everyone involved with the program side of the conference truly wants our submitters to succeed. Help is there for each of you &#8211; all you have to do is ask.
