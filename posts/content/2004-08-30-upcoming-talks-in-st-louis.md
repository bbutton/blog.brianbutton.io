If you happen to be in St. Louis any time over the next few weeks, I&#8217;m talking at a couple of different user groups. On Wednesday, Sept 1, from 7-9PM, I&#8217;m talking at the XPSTL meeting in St. Charles. And I&#8217;m also talking at the St. Louis OOSIG meeting on Thursday, Sept 16th. The topic of both talks is the same:

Using Programmer Tests as Agile Documentation.

For more information, and an outline of the talk, please see the previous entry in my weblog.
