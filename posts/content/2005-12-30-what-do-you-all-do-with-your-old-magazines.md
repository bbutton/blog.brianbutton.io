I, like most of you, get a ton of magazines per month. I get Dr. Dobbs, MSDN, Software Developer, Runner&rsquo;s World, Sky and Telescope, Infoworld, CRN, and so on. Do you save them? Do you clip certain articles out of them and pitch the rest? Do you just pitch the whole thing when you&rsquo;re finished and rely on the web to find them for you again later?

I&rsquo;m genuinely curious to find out. I&rsquo;m drowning in magazines, and I want to find a way out!
