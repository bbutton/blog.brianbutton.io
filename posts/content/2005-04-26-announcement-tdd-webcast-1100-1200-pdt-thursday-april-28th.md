[Peter Provost][1], [Scott Densmore][2], [Brad Wilson][3], and [I][4] will be doing a webcast on TDD, hosted by [Ron Jacobs][5]. I don&rsquo;t have the link yet, but as soon as I do, I&rsquo;ll post it here.

The content for this webcast is introductory &mdash; we only have 1 hour, so we&rsquo;re going to talk about what TDD is, how it can help, do a really quick example of it, and share some of our war stories of using it on real-life projects.

Please tune in, laugh along with us, and submit lots of questions.

If things go well, this will be the first in a series of webcasts on TDD over the next few months.
