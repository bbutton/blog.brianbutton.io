According to [Scott Densmore][1], barring anything unpredictable happening, Version 1.0 of the Enterprise Library will be released to the web on January, 28th. It will be available MSDN and the [patterns & practices][2] site.

Hmmm. Rumor has it that [Agile Solutions Group][3] will soon be offering training classes on Enterprise Library as well as consulting services revolving around using it. Email <entlib@agilesolutionsgroup.com> if you&rsquo;re interested ðŸ™‚
