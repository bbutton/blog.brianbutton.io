At long last, I can officially announce the **<u>2006 St. Louis Code&nbsp; Camp</u>**, to be held the weekend of May 6th and 7th, in Creve Coeur, MO. The code camp will be held in the offices of Microsoft at Three City Place, at the corner of Ballas and Olive, and will meet from 8:30 until 5 each day. Final plans for the number of sessions we can accept are still being drawn up, but we should have enough room for lots of good presentations.

A web site is in the process of being set up at [www.stlcodecamp.org][1]. On that site will soon be the camp schedule, list of speakers, map to the camp location, and a link to register. Registration is going to be limited to about 150 people due to size constraints of our facility.

**Call for Volunteers**

Much help is still being sought in organizing. I need someone to help create the web site, I need help planning some after-session activities for Saturday night, and lots of other things. If you&rsquo;re interested in volunteering, please email me at <codecamp-volunteers@agilestl.com>.

**Call for Speakers**

This will also serve as the first Call for Speakers. If you want to speak at the code camp, please email me a description of your presentation. This is a non-competitive speaker selection process, so the first speakers who register will be given speaking slots until the slots fill up. Feel free to speak on any development-related topic, including Java, C++, C#,&nbsp;.Net, Ruby, Lua, Agile programming techniques, Unix, Linux,&nbsp;MacOS,&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;AOP, or anything else you&rsquo;re passionate about.&nbsp;The only requirement is that your presentation and any sample code must be made available to all code camp attendees with no restrictions on their use. Please email session descriptions to <codecamp-speakers@agilestl.com>.

This blog will serve as the primary means of announcing news about the St. Louis Code Camp until&nbsp; the web site is set up. Once that is up and running, all news and information will be available from there.

**For more information on Code Camps**

You can get more information on what code camps are and how you can contribute at <http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/archive/2004/12/12/280181.aspx>{.moz-txt-link-freetext}&nbsp;. If you have any other questions, please drop me a note, and I can help answer your question.

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing many of you there!
