I am very pleased to announce that I have accepted a position as the Vice President of Engineering&nbsp;at [Asynchrony Solutions, Inc.][1], a leading agile development firm&nbsp;based in St. Louis, MO, effective May 1st, 2006. I&rsquo;m thrilled to take this new position, as the spirit, principles, and values of Asynchrony very closely mirror my own &mdash; honesty, integrity, agility, openness, and all that other good stuff. In my new role, I will be responsible for&nbsp;helping align the agile project processes and practices with the larger business goals of the organization, developing an entirely new training division specializing in agile development and management practices, creating a .Net development practice, acting as a mentor to Asynchrony&rsquo;s growing body of agile coaches, and managing several development projects for our clients.

I am unbelievably excited about this opportunity. I will be stepping away from day to day development tasks in part (not entirely!!!), but&nbsp;I will be responsible for helping to set the overall agile direction of the entire company. My goal is to publish as much as I can about our successes (and failures if allowed ![][2]), further the art of agile project management, and develop an effective way to sell defense contractors on agility wrapped inside their CMM-based processes. I truly want to be as transparent as I can about my activities, as I haven&rsquo;t seen anywhere nearly enough published about this part of agility.

The one downside to this (and it is a tremendous downside) is that I&rsquo;m going to have to leave the [patterns & practices][3] team at Microsoft. I have had an incredible 2&ndash;1/2 year run with them, I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from some outstanding people ([Tom][4], [Scott][5], [Peter][6], [Brad][7], [EdJez][8], and now [Jason][9] and [Don][10], plus too many more to mention), and I would not trade that experience for the entire world. Contrary to what outsiders might think, Microsoft is an incredible place to work &mdash; everyone you meet is consistently brilliant, helpful, and they all _get it_. Think what you may about the corporation Microsoft &mdash; they have amazing people. And mostly, I want to thank [Jim Newkirk][11] for having the faith in me to bring me into p&p all those many months ago, despite the objections of Scott and Naveen&nbsp;![][2]&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve known Jim for 10 years and consider him to be a very close friend, and I do thank him for all he&rsquo;s done.

I do intend to keep up this blog, still writing about technical topics as I can, but I&rsquo;ll also expand its topics to include more management-based learnings. I&rsquo;m excited about this, and I can&rsquo;t wait to start.

Yours truly,

Brian Button  
V.P. of Engineering
