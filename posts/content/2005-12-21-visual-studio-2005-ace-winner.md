Imagine my surprise when I woke up yesterday, checked my MSN email, and found a note from Soma ![][1]&nbsp;It seems that someone out there nominated me for an ACE (Award for Customer Excellence) for helping get VS.Net 2005 out the door, and Soma was writing to tell me that I had won. I have to admit, I was not expecting this at all (in fact, I had never heard of this until Sam Gentile mentioned that he got one), so I was really pleased when I saw it. The feedback I gave (almost entirely on the testing system) was intended to make VSTS more amenable to an agile development team, and for the most part wasn&rsquo;t implemented in the current release ![][2]&nbsp;But they are on the table for Orcas at least!

Anyhow, I&rsquo;m very pleased to have won this award, as its nice to have one&rsquo;s contributions noticed. Thanks, MS!
