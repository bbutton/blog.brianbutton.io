The article I wrote about some months ago is finally published in the [February, 2005][1] issue of [Better Software Magazine][2]. I spent a lot of time on that article, and to see it in print is particularly satisfying. There is a [discussion forum][3] for the article currently being hosted on [Sticky Minds][4], so if you&rsquo;d like to comment on the article or participate in the conversation, please visit.

I am also actively developing the TestMap application I speak of in the article. All versions of TestMap are available via at <http://www.agilesolutionsgroup.com/TestMap>.
