[Here][1] are the slides from today&rsquo;s webcast. Thanks who all tuned in.

There will be a slight delay in posting the code from the webcast, as I seem to have accidentally deleted it in the process of getting it ready to be uploaded. I was trying to get rid of all the bin and obj directories, and I did. I also got rid of all the source code ![][2]&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll try to recreate it tonight and post it tomorrow.

Doh!
