I was asked by the local VB.Net User Group to give a talk on Agile Development. The problem with giving a talk like this is that there are so many possible things to cover in the time allotted. And I never know what kind of background the folks showing up will have.

So, if I explain this in another way, I have a specific time in which my talk has to fit, I have a specific amount of resources to deliver the talk (me!), and my requirements are unclear. This sure sounds like most agile software projects! What I&#8217;ve done now twice in a situation like this is to let the talk itself become an example of agility. I walk in with an idea about the subjects I want to cover. For example, last night it was

  * What are Agility and Extreme Programming
  * How do they work
  * What is a programmer&rsquo;s life like
  * How do we adopt it

When I walk in, I give a short intro talking about how I they are my customers, I am their value-giver (developer), and my goal is to give them the most value for their next hour of time. We discuss how I am going to run the talk as if it is a software project, and we proceed to brainstorm for what questions, or features, I can answer for them in the next hour.

They brainstormed way more questions than I could answer in the time given, so we had a quick conversation about prioritizing based on business value. Then I gave them a quick estimate of about 2 minutes per question and told them that I was breaking the talk up into 10 minute releases or iterations. So we chose our top 5 questions from the first line in the list above, and we started off.

At the end of ten minutes, I&nbsp; had answered 3 of the questions, which led into a quick discussion of planning and feedback. I told them that I could now promise them 3 questions every 10 minutes, since that&rsquo;s the progress we had measured, and I had them pick out their next 3 questions to get answered. It turned out I answered 4 questions this iteration, with one being really short and quick in the final minute.

We did one more iteration after that, followed by a wrapup discussion of how the talk was planned and executed and related that back to a software project.

I&rsquo;ve found that this is a good way for me to give a talk when I&rsquo;m not sure of my audience. It lets me tailor the talk as we go to exactly what they&rsquo;d like to hear, and prevents me from giving the wrong talk to the wrong group, which I&rsquo;ve done before ![][1]
