The St. Louis Code Camp was yesterday, and it went great. We had 72 people there, 14 talks, lots of good conversation, and we even gave away an xbox 360!

I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who volunteered, everyone who showed up, and all the speakers. A great time was had by all. The best news out of all of this is that people were practically demanding that we do this again in the fall!

So, I guess we&rsquo;ll start tihs all over again in a few months. Anyone want to speak???

For those of you who spoke, please send me links to content I can link to on my blog ASAP.
