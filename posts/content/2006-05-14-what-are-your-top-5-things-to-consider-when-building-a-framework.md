Help me out with an experiment&hellip;

I&rsquo;m finishing up the slides and content for my TechEd talk, and I want to do a little research based on the community. The subject of my talk is &ldquo;Architecting your own enterprise framework&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m curious to know what you consider when you&rsquo;re doing this, and what you&rsquo;d like to hear someone talk about. This is going to be used in the structure of my talk to make a point about how frameworks are built, so your answers are very important to me.

Please drop me a note at <bbutton@agilestl.com> with your answers!

I appreciate any help I get from this, and I hope to see many of you in Boston!
