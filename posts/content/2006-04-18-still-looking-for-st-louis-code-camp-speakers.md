For any of you planning on attending the [St. Louis Code Camp][1], we are still looking for speakers. If you have ever wanted to try your hand at sharing some of your knowledge with your fellow developers, Code Camps are a great place to start out. Talks are very low key, audiences are very friendly, and you&rsquo;ll give yourself a big leg up for that next presentation you have to give to your great-grand boss at work ![][2]

If you&rsquo;re interested, please go to our web site and site up to attend and to speak. We&rsquo;d love to have you!
