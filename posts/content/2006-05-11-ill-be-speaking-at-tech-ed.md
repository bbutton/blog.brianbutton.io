I&rsquo;ve been meaning to post this for a while, but I&rsquo;m finally making myself do it now&hellip;

I&rsquo;ll be giving a presentation on &ldquo;Creating Your Own Enterprise Application Framework&rdquo; at Tech Ed in Boston, on Friday, June 16 at 9:00 AM in Grand Ballroom A. My talk is based on experiences in my 2&ndash;1/2 years in patterns & practices and how I believe we most successfully build our libraries and frameworks. I set out to build a technical talk on this subject but quickly came to the realization that framework and library building is just as much about the softer skills of team building, politics, and negotiation.

If you&rsquo;re going to be in the area, look me up!
