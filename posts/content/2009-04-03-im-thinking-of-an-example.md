  I&#8217;m writing an example for a workshop on estimation in an agile context, and I&#8217;m considering using the idea of preparing a multi-course meal. I think I like this because it is entirely non-technical, so I can give it to developers, customers, QA, or anyone else without regard to previous technical knowledge. I also like it because there are obvious tie-ins to concepts like freshness, inventory, rapid delivery, and so on. That is as close to the real-world considerations of a software project I can think of while keeping it approachable for everyone.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  So, here goes:
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  I have 100 guests showing up in 6 hours for an end of project celebration. This is the entire project team and their families. They did a great job on their last delivery, so we want to reward them with a feast. The menu is top secret, but we want it to surprise and delight them as much as possible. Here is the schedule:
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  12:00PM &#8211; 1:00PM &#8211; Guests start arriving. I need hors d&#8217;oeuvres ready and passed around through the crowd as they gather.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  1:00PM-2:00PM &#8211; Salad and appetizer course served
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  3:00PM-4:00PM &#8211; Lunch
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  5:00PM-5:30PM &#8211; Dessert and Coffee
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  That gives us 4 different courses to serve. I have a kitchen filled with supplies, everything you might need. The pantry is well stocked, tons of pots and pans, spices, herbs, three ovens and stoves, and anything else you might need. I just need you and your team of world-class chefs to create something for me and my guests.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  I&#8217;d like to have 4 or 5 different hors d&#8217;oeuvres, 3 different kinds of salads, 2 kinds of appetizers. Lunch should be a buffet of 3 meats, 2 pasta dishes, 3 vegetables, and a rice dish. I&#8217;d like 3 different desserts, one decadently sweet, one fruit dish, and a big cake.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  So, off you go. Give me a selection of great food at each of these times. Bear in mind that things can go wrong, like ovens not working, menus changed, schedules shortening, so you&#8217;ll have to constantly keep your eye on time and delivering the best culinary value for the given effort.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  So, how did that sound? I intend to mix things up by adding vegetarian dishes to the lunch menu, an oven going out, changing the schedule, running out of something&#8230; Basically doing whatever it takes to have them adapt, replan, and go forward.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  Does this sound close enough to a real software project to be useful? Does the exercise sound like anything that would teach estimation and prioritization? Any sort of feedback would be greatly appreciated.
