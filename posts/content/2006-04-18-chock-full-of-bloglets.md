Hi, All,

This entry should have something in it for everybody, since I have a bunch of little things to say.

  * Friday is my last day at [patterns & practices][1]. I want to thank everyone there who has put up with me for 2&ndash;1/2 years. The experiences I&rsquo;ve had there and&nbsp;the friends I&rsquo;ve made there&nbsp;will last me the rest of my life. And hopefully I&rsquo;ve left something of myself behind that will help them in their future endeavors. And if you&rsquo;re ever in doubt, guys, just ask yourself, WWBD ![][2]
  * I will be speaking at TechEd this year, so if you&rsquo;re going to be there, please look me up. My talk is on Building Your Own Enterprise Framework. I intend to talk about things I learned, both good and bad, during my experiences in building frame^h^h^h^h^hlibraries like EntLib. You can expect this talk to have an agile bent to it ![][2]
  * I&rsquo;m headed down to Atlanta next weekend for the [FIRST][3]&nbsp;Lego League&nbsp;National Championships. Linsey, my 12 year old daughter, was part of a team of 4 students who won the [Missouri state championship][4]. Now they&rsquo;re off to compete at the Nationals in Atlanta next weekend. And then 2 weeks after that, they&rsquo;re off to compete in the European championships in Eindhoven as one of 5 US teams invited to compete there.
  * I&rsquo;m doing a webcast Thursday on Building your own Enterprise Library Design Time. I don&rsquo;t have the registration link yet, but I&rsquo;ll post it as soon as I do as a separate blog entry.
  * My friend [John Sextro][5] gave a talk at the [St. Louis Extreme Programming Users Group][6] last night on the refactoring Move Embellishment to Decorator. In his example, John did the main part of the refactoring in one giant leap. I challenged him to do it in smaller steps, so that he&rsquo;d have working code throughout the exercise. John took me up on the challenge, and [he blogged about how it turned out][7]. Great job, John!
  * This is my 100th blog entry! I&rsquo;ve been trying to save up for something extra special, but I don&rsquo;t have time to do a big blog entry right now, and I couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer to blog these things. So, Happy 100th Posting to Me!
