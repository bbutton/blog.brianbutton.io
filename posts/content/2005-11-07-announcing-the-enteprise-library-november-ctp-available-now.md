[patterns & practices][1] is proud to release to the web [Enterprise Library for .NET Framework 2.0: November 2005 CTP][2] (that&rsquo;s&nbsp;a mouthful!). This version of the library has been recoded to take advantage of the&nbsp; new .NET Framework 2.0 features, including database providers, better support for logging and tracing, and the new System.Configuration subsystem. Blocks included in this release are:

  * Caching
  * Data
  * Logging
  * Exception Handling
  * Security
  * Security Caching

  <p>
    You can expect a series of webcasts discussing the various new features of the library to be coming soon. Keep an eye on this blog for updates on this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The final version of the library will be released (if all goes well!) someplace around the middle of December, 2005.
