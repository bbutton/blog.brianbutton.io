I&#8217;m a few days late to this party, but my friends [Jim Newkirk][1] and [Brad Wilson][2] have released a [new .Net testing framework(http://www.codeplex.com/xunit). What is interesting about this framework is that it is built based on many years of combined experience between Jim and Brad, with input, I&#8217;m sure, from [Scott][3], [Peter][4], and others.

Jim and Brad made some interesting choices, like removing SetupAttribute and TearDownAttribute, but they&#8217;ve defended their choices.

Go check it out. And while you&#8217;re there, please vote for adding an adapter to allow xUnit tests to be run through [ReSharper][5]. You can do this by logging into [CodePlex][6], or creating an account if you&#8217;ve never logged in, and going to here to vote. Having this in ReSharper would make my .Net development complete ðŸ™‚

Last point, if any of you are developing .Net code, and you are not using ReSharper, why the !@#$!@# not??? Give yourself a treat and check it out.
