I gave an introduction to Powershell talk at the St. Louis .Net UG meeting on Monday, October 29th to about 70-80 people or so. I introduced basic concepts of powershell, talked about a few problems I had solved with it, and showed some simple scripts.

At the end of the presentation, I promised to post [the slides][1] by the end of this week, and I&#8217;m making it Wednesday night. Believe me when I say that me getting something finished early is a minor miracle ðŸ™‚
