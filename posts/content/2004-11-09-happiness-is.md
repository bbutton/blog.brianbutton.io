Spambayes.

A long time ago, in a [blog][1] far, far away, I pined for something to free me from this prison of spam. My good friend, [Peter Provost][2], turned me onto [Spambayes][3].

This single tool has given me back my inbox. I&#8217;ve been targeted these past few days by a particularly nasty spam that has been sent to me over 300 times in the last 24 hours. Spambayes caught each and every one of them, and I didn&#8217;t even know they were there until I went back to look at the spam that had been filtered for me.

Ahhh, heaven ðŸ™‚ I have my inbox back again!

Here are the stats over the past week or so:

SpamBayes has processed 7238 messages &#8211;   
1705 (24%) good, 4568 (63%) spam and 422 (5%) unsure.   
1619 messages were manually classified as good (0 were false positives).   
5249 messages were manually classified as spam (99 were false negatives).   
2 unsure messages were manually identified as good, and 415 as spam.
