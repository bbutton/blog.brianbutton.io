For anyone out there interested in TDD training, Asynchrony will be holding a public TDD course in our offices in St. Louis June 12th-14th. If you have been interested in learning TDD, I promise you&#8217;ll enjoy this class. I&#8217;ll be teaching it personally, with the help of some very capable coaches. Good times will be had by all!
