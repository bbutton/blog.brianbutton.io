I&rsquo;ll be speaking about the Enterprise Library project I&rsquo;ve been working on at Microsoft since early 2004 at the C# UG in St. Louis on Monday, January 10th.

I&rsquo;ll be talking about the design of the Enterprise Library, showing off some of its capabilities, and demonstrating its common configuration tooling. Given time, I&rsquo;ll also be building a sample application, to&nbsp;illustrate how simple it is to consume it in your own application.

For time, location, and more&nbsp;information, see [http://www.stlcsharp.net][1].
