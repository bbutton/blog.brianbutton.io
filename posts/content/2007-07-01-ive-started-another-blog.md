I&#8217;ve had a bunch of personal thoughts and ideas that I&#8217;ve wanted to post over time, but I&#8217;ve always refrained from posting them here. So, instead, I&#8217;ve created another blog. I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;m going to host it permanently, so I&#8217;m housing it temporarily on blogspot.

Check it out [here][1] if you&#8217;d like to read any of this. If you live in St. Louis, and especially the Rockwood School District, it is likely fairly relevant to you.
