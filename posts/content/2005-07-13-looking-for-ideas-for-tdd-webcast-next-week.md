I&#8217;m currently scheduled to take part in a TDD webcast next Wednesday, and I&#8217;m looking for advice about what to cover. We&#8217;ve already done a basic, &#8220;This is TDD&#8221; webcast in May or so, so I&#8217;m looking for what Chapter 2 should be.

Ideas I&#8217;ve had include

  * TDD Around the Edges &mdash; how to TDD code that touches APIs, servers, databases, etc
  * TDD and its affect on Architecture &mdash; how TDD affects the architecture of a system

Whatever we do, it has to be coverable in roughly 50 minutes of talking plus demos.

Any ideas? You name it, and we&rsquo;re likely to do it!
