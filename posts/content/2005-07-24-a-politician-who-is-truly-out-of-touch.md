I just read an [article][1] about possible changes to Daylight Savings Time in the US. They want to start it two weeks earlier and end it one week later. But here is the best part.

Fred Upton, R-Michigan, had this comment:

_Kids across the nation will soon rejoice because they&rsquo;ll have another hour of daylight trick-or-treating._

Now, this is truly a man without a clue. Is there anyone out there, parent or child, that _wants_ to go trick-or-treating in daylight????

And these are the people who make our laws&hellip;

(Note, this is an apolitical comment. It is just a comment on how _all_ politicians are completely out of touch with reality)
