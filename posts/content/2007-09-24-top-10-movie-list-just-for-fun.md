My wife, Sharon, and I were talking about our top 10 movie list and what would be on it. The requirements were pretty simple. These had to be movies that we would generally stop what we were doing and watch together. Just because one of us like it wasn&#8217;t enough to make the list &#8212; it had to be both.

Here they, are in random order:

  * A Few Good Men
  * Field of Dreams
  * The Shawshank Redemption
  * Bull Durham
  * Remember the Titans
  * Top Gun
  * Back to the Future
  * Men In Black
  * Breakfast Club

No real point to this post, but I thought I&#8217;d share ðŸ™‚
