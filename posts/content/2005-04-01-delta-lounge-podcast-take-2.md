The [second part][1] of our continuing conversation with Ron Jacobs about&nbsp;our time in the Delta Lounge. [Scott][2], [Peter][3], and [I][4] get further into team dynamics, pair programming, things that went right, and things that went wrong. Tons of fun to create, hopefully as much fun to listen to!
