This Thursday, Tom Hollander and I will be presenting a web cast on building your own application block using Enterprise Library January 2006. The talk will discuss how to take a piece of functionality that you have built and plug it into the configuration system, so that it can be constructed using our provider-based factories.

The topics will include:

  1. Building the simplest Application Block possible
  2. Attaching configuration to the block
  3. Allowing for variability through custom providers
  4. Creating your own configuration objects for your providers

And if time allows, I&rsquo;ll be discussing how to create and attach instrumentation to your new application block.

Tell all your friends &mdash; it should be a blast. Look for the signup link to be posted early this week.
