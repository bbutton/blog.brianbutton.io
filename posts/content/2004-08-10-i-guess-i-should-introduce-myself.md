I&#8217;m Brian Button, and I own [Agile Solutions Group][1]. My 30-second elevator speech goes something like, &#8220;Agile Solutions Group works with small to medium size business and teams that creates software as part of their business, but not as their primary business function. I can show them how to build better, faster, stronger software using less time and fewer people, and creating the software with higher quality than anyone else in their industry. I can get their product to market faster, with higher quality than anyone else around.&#8221; I know, kind of lame, but I&#8217;m still working on it.

The speech above was my original business goal, but circumstances seem to have guided me somewhere else. Over the last 18 months or so, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my time teaching Test Driven Development to well over 100 students, developing real-time C++ software for an embedded control system, and worked in the [Patterns and Practices][2] group at Microsoft. While I&#8217;ve enjoyed all of it, my time at P&P has been my favorite. I&#8217;ve always been a Linux bigot, but my opinion of the people working at MS has changed completely. I can honestly say that every single person I&#8217;ve met has been a pleasure to work with. They are, without fail, brilliant, and they _get_ software.

In my 8 months there, I have had the pleasure of being solely responsible for the implementation of one of their great Application Blocks, the [Smart-Client][3] block. I learned a lot about the development culture in Patterns and Practices while building that block, and I hope also affected it towards a more agile culture at the same time. I do know that TDD is becoming a lot more acceptable and frequent in that group, and I&#8217;d like to think I had some part in that. Now I&#8217;m working on another block-related project that&#8217;s hush-hush, but I&#8217;m test-infecting them as well!

You can see more details about me on [my web site][1], including my resume.

If you&#8217;ve actually read this, please drop me a note. I&#8217;d like to know that I&#8217;m not talking to myself&#8230;
