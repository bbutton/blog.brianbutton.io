Thanks to the kind folks at Better Software Magazine and Sticky Minds, I have my [article][1], as published, as a PDF.

In this article, I discuss how to write programmer tests in a little different way to support them being used as API documentation. Tests needs to stand alone a little bit more,&nbsp;you need to pay more attention to using better names, and you need to have some way to let you map from application method to the tests that define it.

Enjoy!

Update:

I know I mentioned my TestMap software in the article, but I got distracted while I was creating it, and I never had a chance to finish it. It is still on my list of things to do, but it is not in any sort of presentable format right now. I&#8217;ll post here when I do have a chance to get back to it.
