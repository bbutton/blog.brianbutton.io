Sorry for the late notice, but I&rsquo;m doing a teched webcast tomorrow on Refactoring. I&rsquo;d love it if a big crowd showed up! Here is the link to listen:

<http://www.microsoft.com/communities/eventdetails.mspx?CMTYSvcSource=MSCOMMedia&Params=%7eCMTYDataSvcParams%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ID%22+Value%3d%221032273124%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22ProviderID%22+Value%3d%22A6B43178-497C-4225-BA42-DF595171F04C%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22lang%22+Value%3d%22en%22%2f%5e%7earg+Name%3d%22cr%22+Value%3d%22US%22%2f%5e%7esParams%5e%7e%2fsParams%5e%7e%2fCMTYDataSvcParams%5e>

Yeah, I know &mdash; what kind of system do they have to create URLs that long! Show up anyhow and ask lots of good questions.

Hope to see some of you there.
