For those of you interested, and in St. Louis, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the .Net Users Group meeting this month. My topic will be &#8220;Refactoring: Adding Design to your Code After It Is Written&#8221;. My underlying intent in this talk is to convince people that refactoring is a worthwhile activity, as it adds value to your code.

I intend to walk through some simple refactorings to improve a piece of procedural code and begin to flesh out its dumb data objects into living, breathing OO classes.

Outline:

  1. Introduction of me (boring!)
  2. Imagine yourself walking into work and being asked to make a change to some code you&#8217;ve never seen before&#8230;
  3. Maybe if we improve it a bit, we can read it better&#8230;
  4. Good, now I can read it, maybe I can start thinking about changing it
  5. This is refactoring!
  6. New buzzword, not reworking. Can stop in middle
  7. Let&#8217;s improve the code a bit more and see where that goes&#8230;
  8. Why can I do this? (tests, better code, etc)
  9. These are my tools (brain, patterns, refactoring book)
 10. Here are the reasons why I can&#8217;t do this&#8230;
 11. What else can we improve in the code
 12. Other resources
 13. GIVEAWAY!!!

We have 3 signed copies of Jim Newkirk&#8217;s _Test Driven Development in Microsoft .Net_ and may have a copy or two of the Resharper refactoring tool to give away.

Hope to see lots of you there.
