[Ron Jacobs][1] has up Part 1 of a 2&ndash;part podcast series that [Peter Provost][2], [Scott Densmore][3], and [I][4] did about our working environment during Enterprise Library V1 development. I consider the fact that we were all put into the same room to be **_the critical success factory_** in letting us get Enterprise Library out the door in the time that we did, with the quality it has.

Our conversations in the 2&ndash;part series roam through how and why we used the Delta Lounge, who was in there, why it was important that devs, architects, and test were all in there at the same time, how our choices in music help draw us together as a team, and more.

It was a lot of fun to do, so I have to believe its going to be a lot of fun to listen to. So, hear it from the horses&rsquo; mouths [here][5]!
