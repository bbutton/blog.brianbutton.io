I gave a talk to the local PMI on Friday morning, and I promised them some links they could use to learn more about the subject. I&#8217;ve gone ahead and added those links to my page at <http://del.icio.us/bbutton> . I&#8217;ll keep adding information to that page as I remember or find new links.

Here is a summary of what I have now:

<u>Websites:</u>

  * <http://www.agilealliance.org>
  * <http://www.xprogramming.com>
  * <http://www.controlchaos.com>
  * <http://www.cutter.com/project.html>

<u>Books:</u>

  * [Agile Project Management with Scrum][1]
  * [Agile Project Management : Creating Innovative Solutions][2]
  * [Agile and Iterative Development : A Manager&#8217;s Guide][3]

<u>Blogs and Mailing Lists:</u>

  * [Agile Project Management][4]
  * [Yahoo Agile Project Management Group][5]
  * [Yahoo Agile Management Group][6]

There are many more resources on the web, but this should be enough to get you going. If you have any questions, or would like a pointer to more specific content, please drop me a note through my blog.

Thanks!
