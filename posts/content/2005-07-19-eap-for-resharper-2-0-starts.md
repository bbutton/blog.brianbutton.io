After many weeks and months of waiting, the Early Access Program for ReSharper 2.0 has begun. Grab it [here][1]!!

For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, ReSharper is a plug in for Visual Studio .Net that adds in a bunch of refactorings, navigation helpers, and other stuff that just makes you more productive. There are separate downloads for VS2003 and VS2005.

Grab it, use it, and tell &lsquo;em about it!
