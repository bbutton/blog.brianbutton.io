My good friend, [Matt Philip][1], wrote an [interesting blog entry][2] the other day about Six-Word Memoirs By Writers Famous and Obscure. I thought it might be interesting to write about the agile methods, their values, and their practices, following a similar style. So here goes, my own take on Six-Word Memoirs on Agile Values, People, and Activities&#8230;

Agile: Business plans, developers do, people thrive 
  
Agile: Don&#8217;t want &#8220;resources&#8221;, give me people! 
  
Agile: Project success comes from working together 
  
Agile: Engine converting features to software daily 
  
Agile: Solve biggest problem. Lather, rinse, repeat

QA: Hey, I made the team!!! Yea, QA!!! 
  
QA: Building it right the first time 
  
QA: Equal parts developer, tester, and customer 
  
QA: The glue that holds &#8216;em together 
  
QA: Helping customers define what they want

Scrum Master: Equal parts facilitator, friend, and psychologist 
  
Scrum Master: My job is to listen carefully 
  
Scrum Master: If I do it, you don&#8217;t! 
  
Scrum Master: Fixing problems is not the solution

Customer: Content is mine, method is yours 
  
Customer: I chart the course to success 
  
Customer: You let me worry about that 
  
Customer: Word of mouth, my best tool 
  
Customer: Don&#8217;t read specs, ask me questions

Developer: I eat user stories for breakfast 
  
Developer: I trust my customer and team 
  
Developer: It feels good to be valued 
  
Developer: Method is mine, content is yours 
  
Developer: Best architectures owned by whole team 
  
Developer: Ivory tower architects need not apply 
  
Developer: Red, green, refactor. Lather, rinse, repeat. 
  
Developer: Its more fun done in pairs

Delivery: Running, tested features &#8211; what really counts 
  
Delivery: Scope is negotiable, quality is not 
  
Delivery: Not over, under promising, just delivering 
  
Delivery: Reliably delighting the customer every week

I could do more, but lets leave it there. Any more?
