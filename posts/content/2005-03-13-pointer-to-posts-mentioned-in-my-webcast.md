Hi, all,

I hope some of you had a chance to listen to my [webcast][1] yesterday on the Enterprise Library Caching block. I did an OK job &mdash; I was a little nervous at first and felt very rushed during it. Anyhow, I hope the content I wanted to get in was understandable&hellip;

At one point, someone in the talk asked about thread safety and performance of the&nbsp; block, and I mentioned that I had blogged about how the locking scheme in the caching block evolved over time. I wanted to post links to those previous articles to make them easier to find:

  * [Thread-safety and Hashtables][2]&nbsp;&mdash; First pass at fixing the problem until our testers told me it didn&rsquo;t work üôÅ
  * [Simple Solution to Hashtables and Thread Safety][3] &mdash; My final solution

Scott and I also chatted very briefly about statics. Here is a link to Scott talking about an email that I sent him very early in my time at p&p

  * [Why Singletons are Evil][4]&nbsp;&mdash; Many of these same reasons apply to naked statics as well.

Let me know if I can answer any questions about these posts or anything else I talked about during my webcast.

[Scott Densmore][5] and I talked about doing a few podcasts with [Ron Jacobs][6] covering other aspects of our experiences on [Enterprise Library][7]. We want to bring in [Peter Provost][8] and talk about our Triangle Lounge bullpen and our TDD process. Ron and I also talked about filming a video of an Enterprise Library presentation I&rsquo;ve done in the past where I show about 10 lines of code and spend the rest of the hour using the configuration tool to play with them. Look for these [pnplive][9] shows in the coming month or so.

&mdash; bab
