Astronomy is one of my major hobbies. I have a 10&rdquo; Discovery PDHQ Dobsonian that I take out _waaaay_ to infrequently. But when I do get out, I see things that are really beautiful. The last time I went out, a few weeks ago, I saw [this][1], one of my favorite celestial sights. It looks great in this picture, but I saw it with my own eyes. Clear and bright. _That_ was fun.
