I admit it. Spam has me beat.

A few weeks ago, I got around 1000 spam a day.

Two weeks ago, I got 2000 spams a day.

Last week, 3000 per day.

Are you picking up the pattern yet? As of today, I got 4500 spams. By next week, I&#8217;ll be over 5000, I just know it.

Does anyone out there have any suggestions about how to tame this problem? I have spambayes in the middle of my mailtool chain, so I don&#8217;t see very many of these, but I still have to deal with the bandwidth they take up. And I still see over 100 per day.

My requirements are that I want to be able to read my mail on any of my machines, and I want to have the email backed up safely nightly. I also have to control the mailboxes that I use. I currently have 100 or so active email addresses on my domain, so I need to be able to create and delete addresses at will.

Any advice? Please? I&#8217;m begging here.

UPDATE &mdash; My predictions were far too conservative. I got 7500 spams yesterday. I gotta get some help. This is email spam, and I want to get rid of it so I never see it. I really want something to sit between fetchmail on my linux box and my POP account to sift through and get rid of my spam before I download it. I really don&rsquo;t want challenge/response solutions, because that places an undo burden on people sending me business email. I&rsquo;d also be happy with a different mail service that still looked like agilestl.com, but did all the filtering for me server side. Suggestions are most welcome&hellip;
