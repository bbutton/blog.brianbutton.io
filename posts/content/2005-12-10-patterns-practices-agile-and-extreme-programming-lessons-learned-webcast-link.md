Sorry I didn&rsquo;t get this link out in time for folks to tune in live, but I spaced on it ![][1]&nbsp;Anyhow, [Peter Provost][2], [Brad Wilson][3], [Darrell Snow][4], and I did a webcast about a week ago talking about lessons learned during our projects (EnterpriseLibrary and CAB). We ran both of these projects using similar Agile methods, had great results in both, and talked about what went well and what we wanted to improve on for next time.

If you feel the urge to listen in to our conversations from this webcast, here is the [link][5].
