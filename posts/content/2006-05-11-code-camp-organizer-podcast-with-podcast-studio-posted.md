I was asked by [Jeff Julian and John Alexander][1] to participate in a podcast of MSDN Code Camp organizers yesterday evening, and the resulting podcast has been [posted][2].

The group consisted of Jeff and John, along with Thom Robbins, the originator of Code Camps, Don Demsak (DonXML) from the NJ Code Camp, Chris Williams and Robin Edwards from the South Carolina Code Camps and yours truly. It was a round-table discussion of aspects of organizing and holding a Code Camp. The entire podcast went very well, except for when I accidentally pressed the Suspend button on my keyboard and mysteriously vanished for several minutes üôÅ

Thanks to Jeff and John for asking, thanks to the rest of the panelists for participating, and mostly, thanks to the folks who attended, volunteered, and spoke at the St. Louis Code Camp.
