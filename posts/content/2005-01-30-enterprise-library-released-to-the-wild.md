I know I&rsquo;m a few days late to this party, but I&rsquo;ve been recovering from workaholism for the past few days. Now, feeling refreshed and energetic, I add my voice to the growing firestorm:

Check out the [Enterprise Library][1]. It is everything you have ever hoped for, dreamed about, and wanted, for your software development needs ðŸ™‚

Compliments cheerfully accepted. Criticisms consciously sought and appreciated. After all, we want to get better.
